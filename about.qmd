Hey there! I am Clément - Clem for you!

## About me?

I am a happy husband and father of two amazing boys - who are making my life even more exciting than my work 😉.

I have a passionate job: I am leading the Technology Cluster for Digital Mechatronics at Siemens Healthineers. Taking shortcuts, I am responsible for building up a team of experts in digitalization, and trigger and lead technological projects to enhance the development of our mechatronic products.

Prior to that, I was Team Lead and Model-based Development expert at Modelon and at other industry leaders such as Airbus Helicopters and Dassault Systèmes. 

I do have quite too many engineering degrees 😅: two MSc - in France and Spain - in System Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, and a PhD on model-based hydraulic actuation system design for helicopters. Why? I could tell you when we meet 😉

But you are not here for me, you are here for the reading about **modeling and simulation**! [Start your learning journey! ->](./001-Commitment.qmd)
